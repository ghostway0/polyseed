Has [this](https://bash-org-archive.com/?244321) ever happened to you?

Have you ever said, "I need a post quantum PAKE but no one implemented it"?

It is an implementation of [RLWE-PAKE](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/552.pdf). I'm NOT a cryptographer (actually, very far from it) - use at your own risk.
